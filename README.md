# Efficient Partial Reduce for PyTorch

## Description
This project aims to design and implement a dynamic partial reduce operation as an easy-to-use collective communication library for PyTorch. The dynamic partial reduce is designed to improve the efficiency of data-parallel distributed training by handling the problem of stragglers.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.2.2
- CUDA (optional, for GPU support)
- pytest (for testing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/romanticthemeRT/project
Create and activate a virtual environment:

<BASH>
conda create -n pytorch2.2.2 python=3.9
conda activate pytorch2.2.2
