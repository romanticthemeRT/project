# Efficient Partial Reduce for PyTorch

## Description
This project aims to design and implement a dynamic partial reduce operation as an easy-to-use collective communication library for PyTorch. The dynamic partial reduce is designed to improve the efficiency of data-parallel distributed training by handling the problem of stragglers.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.2.2
- CUDA (optional, for GPU support)
- pytest (for testing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/efficient_partial_reduce.git](https://github.com/romanticthemeRT/project)
   cd efficient_partial_reduce
